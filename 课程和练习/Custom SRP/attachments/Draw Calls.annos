[{"text":"To draw something the CPU has to tell the GPU what to draw and how. What is drawn is usually a mesh. How it is drawn is defined by a shader, which is a set of instructions for the GPU. Besides the mesh, the shader needs additional information to do its work, including the object's transformation matrices and material properties.","id":"b1baa617-c14c-53e8","type":"highlight","pdfName":"Custom SRP/attachments/Draw Calls.pdf","color":"rgb(255,255,0)","position":{"pageIndex":1,"rects":[[39.74999999999999,734.377,547.9919999999998,747.783],[39.74999999999999,716.377,513.299,729.783],[39.74999999999999,698.377,543.668,711.7829999999999],[39.74999999999999,680.3770000000001,294.52099999999996,693.783]]},"dateCreated":1716789683110,"dateModified":1716789683110,"comments":"111\n","commentTime":1716789690149},{"text":"Unity's LW/Universal and HD RPs allow you to design shaders with the Shader Graph package, which generates shader code for you.
